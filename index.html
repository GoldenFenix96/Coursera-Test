                <p>I fell into a burning ring of fire
                    I went down, down, down
                    And the flames went higher
                    And it burns, burns, burns
                    The ring of fire
                    The ring of fire

                I wear it for another hundred-thousand who have died

                I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
                Because you're mine, I walk the line</p>
